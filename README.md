# 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup
From the FIFA_world_cup_matches.csv file, I was able to use SQL Notebook to build an average statistics and a final world cup table which included stats like
1. Average Possession
2. Number of goals scored
3. Number of yellow cards, red cards, fouls and offsides. 
4. Number of channel passes, interceptions, offers and switches of play.
5. And many more statistics. 

Afterwards, I compiled a PowerBI project to highlight some of the important statistics to tell a story of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Hope you like it :)
